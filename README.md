# Online calculator
- the frontend (made with React) communicates with the backend (made with Node.js) through axios requests
- the operation can either be calculated locally, or
- if a checkbox is checked, the two numbers and operation are sent to the server, which sends back the result as response
- the server also writes all operations in an SQL database (or a JSON file), and sends back to the client/ or deletes the history when requested
